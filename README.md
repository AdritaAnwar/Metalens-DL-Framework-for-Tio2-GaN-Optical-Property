# Metalens-DL-Framework-for-Tio2-GaN-Optical-Property
This repository contains the datasets for the study "Beyond Application-Specific Design: A Generalized Deep Learning Framework for Optical Property Prediction in TiO2/GaN Nanophotonic Metasurfaces."

# Contents
Datasets include phase and transmission property of Tio2 and GaN nanorods.

# Description
In this project, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning frameworks have been been used to circumvent the trial-and-error based method in Optical Property Prediction in TiO2/GaN Nanophotonic Metasurfaces.

# Data Availability
Datasets are available in this repository. For any specific inquiries, please contact Adrita Anwar ([momoadrita@gmail.com](url)).
