# Metalens-DL-Framework-for-TiO2-GaN-Optical-Property
This repository contains the datasets for the study "Beyond Application-Specific Design: A Generalized Deep Learning Framework for Optical Property Prediction in TiO2/GaN Nanophotonic Metasurfaces."

# Contents
Datasets include phase and transmission property of TiO2 and GaN nanorods.

# Description
In this project, deep learning and transfer learning frameworks have been employed to overcome the limitations of traditional trial-and-error approaches in predicting the optical properties of TiOâ‚‚/GaN nanophotonic metasurfaces.

# Data Availability
Datasets are available in this repository. For any specific inquiries, please contact Adrita Anwar ([momoadrita@gmail.com](url)).
